## Type Master (beta)
Type Master was created using React. It boasts a built in stat tracker, timer and my own take on displaying the user inputs vs the placeholder text with dynamic html. 

### Instructions
Click inside the input box and start typing.

### TODO
#### Priority 1
- Implement spans for User Input to control letter coloring
- New line after line is complete

#### Priority 2
- Spell checker
- GET Request for random text blurbs

#### Priority 3
- Stat tracker to track correct words instead of spaces
