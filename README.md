## Type Master (beta)
Type Master was created using React. It boasts a built in stat tracker, timer and my own take on displaying the user inputs vs the placeholder text with dynamic html. 

### Instructions
Click inside the input box and start typing.

#### TODO
The stat tracker and word display is currently being worked on as I am only tracking the user's space inputs for each word but I understand this is a faulty way of tracking words. The words on display should also "scroll down", making the top line of the input the only line that the user uses and am currently testing different methods for this.
